                <p>This site introduces me Zoe Potts. I love to be out in nature and to crochet/sew. I'm currently in a degree for 
                    full stack programming and I plan to graduate and start working next year. My brand is called <em> Made By </em> 
                    which teaches people how to crochet. You can click <b><em><a href="brand.html">Brand Guidelines</a></em></b> 
                    to learn more about the brand. I also have all my GitHub projects and my progress in Codecademy and freeCodeCamp 
                    at the bottom of the page. You can click <b><em><a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></em></b> to learn more 
                    about me.
